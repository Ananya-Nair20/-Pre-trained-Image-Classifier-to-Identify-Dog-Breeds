This project was part of the AI-Programming with Python Nanodregree by Udacity.

Principal Objectives

1) Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.

2) Correctly classify the dog breed, for the images of dogs.

3) Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG) best achieves objectives 1 and 2.

4) Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2 and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each algorithm takes to run.
